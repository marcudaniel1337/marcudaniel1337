# Daniel Marcu

I am a Python developer and level designer based in Bucharest. My work focuses on developing efficient algorithms, machine learning models, and competitive programming solutions, as well as designing maps for games using Source, Source 2, and GoldSrc engines. I studied Artificial Intelligence at the Politehnica University of Bucharest, completing most of the program with strong results before choosing to focus full-time on independent projects.

This GitHub profile presents a selection of my work, with repositories organized around key areas of interest:

My **algorithms** repository contains Python implementations of fundamental algorithms from computer science. It includes graph search algorithms such as Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, A*, and Bellman-Ford, as well as classic sorting algorithms, string processing techniques, and solutions for various combinatorial problems.

In the **machinelearning** repository, I have built machine learning models from first principles. This includes supervised learning algorithms like decision trees and support vector machines, unsupervised techniques such as k-means clustering and DBSCAN, and reinforcement learning approaches like Q-learning. The implementations focus on understanding core mechanics without relying on external libraries beyond basic numerical computation.

The **competitiveprogramming** repository showcases data structures and algorithms used in coding competitions and problem-solving challenges. Examples include segment trees, union-find (disjoint set union), binary search variations, sliding window techniques, and tries. These implementations are designed for performance and correctness in constrained environments.

My **projects** repository brings together applied work, ranging from a semantic search engine and recommendation system to a spam classifier and stock price predictor. These projects combine data science techniques with practical applications.

The **map_sourcefiles** repository contains source files for game maps I have designed for Source, Source 2, and GoldSrc. These maps emphasize balanced gameplay, visual design, and technical performance, and reflect my interest in combining creative and technical work.

In addition, this profile includes archived coursework in the **college_homework** repository, as well as other experimental or learning-focused repositories. 

I am continually expanding my skills and working on new projects, aiming to produce clear, well-structured code and thoughtful designs. My focus is on both the theoretical foundations of computing and their practical application.
